## New Features

You can now:
- Create named collections (optionally tagged with a class name)
- Assign cards to a collection when creating cards
- Filter the flashcard view by selected collection
- Fetch cards by collection through dedicated API endpoints
- Switch between `All Cards` and `Due Cards` study mode
- Rate each review as `Again`, `Hard`, `Good`, or `Easy`
- Track learning progress in a dashboard (due now, mastered, accuracy, reviewed today, weak cards)

## Backend Overview

Main backend file: `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/main.py`

### Data model
- `flashcards`
  - `id`
  - `user_id`
  - `question`
  - `answer`
  - `collection_id` (nullable)
  - `review_count`
  - `correct_count`
  - `ease_factor`
  - `interval_days`
  - `due_at`
  - `last_reviewed_at` (nullable)
  - `streak_current`
  - `streak_best`
- `collections`
  - `id`
  - `user_id`
  - `name`
  - `class_name` (nullable)

### Startup schema guard

`main.py` includes `ensure_schema()` which:
- keeps existing DBs working
- adds missing `flashcards` learning columns when needed
- creates indexes if missing

This avoids dropping tables for existing deployments.

## API Documentation

All endpoints below require a Supabase bearer token in `Authorization` header.

### Health
- `GET /`
  - Returns service status text.

### Collections
- `GET /collections`
  - Lists current user collections.

- `POST /collections`
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Chapter 3",
      "class_name": "Biology 101"
    }
    ```
  - Creates a collection for the authenticated user.

- `DELETE /collections/{collection_id}`
  - Deletes a collection owned by the current user.
  - Cards in that collection are unassigned (`collection_id = null`).

- `GET /collections/{collection_id}/cards`
  - Returns cards in one owned collection.

### Cards
- `GET /cards`
  - Returns all cards for current user.

- `GET /cards?collection_id=123`
  - Returns cards for one owned collection.

- `POST /cards`
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "question": "What is ATP?",
      "answer": "Cell energy currency",
      "collection_id": 123
    }
    ```
  - `collection_id` can be `null`.

- `PUT /cards/{card_id}`
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "question": "Updated question",
      "answer": "Updated answer",
      "collection_id": 123
    }
    ```
  - Updates owned card only.

- `DELETE /cards/{card_id}`
  - Deletes owned card only.

- `POST /cards/{card_id}/review`
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "rating": "good"
    }
    ```
  - Allowed ratings: `again`, `hard`, `good`, `easy`
  - Updates review stats and schedules the next due time for that card.

## Frontend Changes

Updated files:
- `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/index.html`
- `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/script.js`
- `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/style.css`
- `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/quiz.html`
- `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/quiz.js`
- `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/quiz.css`

Added UI:
- Collection dropdown (`All Collections` + user collections)
- `New Collection` button
- Active collection label
- `Study Mode` button on the main page that opens a dedicated quiz webpage
- Quiz webpage with `Due Cards` / `All Cards` mode toggle
- Quiz webpage pop-quiz input (type answer and check)
- Quiz webpage progress dashboard for total, due, mastered, accuracy, and reviewed today

Behavior:
- Cards are fetched according to the selected collection.
- New cards are assigned to selected collection (or unassigned when `All Collections` is selected).
- Quiz checks typed answers against flashcard answers (case/punctuation tolerant).
- Correct first-try answers are logged as strong reviews and can move cards into mastered status.
- Incorrect answers are logged and reduce overall accuracy.

## Deployment Notes

To ship this feature:
1. Redeploy backend service on Render (required).
2. Deploy updated frontend (GitHub Pages or your host) (required for UI feature).
3. Set Supabase auth config on frontend in `/Users/GeneralUse/LinuxHome/FlashcardTest/index.html`:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Set backend auth environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (required when your project signs auth JWTs with HS256)
   - `SUPABASE_JWT_ISSUER` (optional override, defaults to `${SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1`)
5. Supabase does not require a separate app redeploy, but DB schema must include new fields/tables (handled by backend startup guard here).

`DATABASE_URL` note:
- On Render, use Supabase **Connection pooling** URL (host like `aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`, port `6543`).
- Do not use direct host `db.<project-ref>.supabase.co` on platforms without IPv6 egress.
- Include `?sslmode=require` in the URL.

## Local Run (example)

From project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill values in .env
uvicorn main:app --reload --env-file .env
```

Then open `index.html` through your static host or local web server.

## Future Improvements Planned
- Add collection editing (rename, change class name) **(*completed 02/16/26*)**
- Add collection color coding for easier UI differentiation **(*completed 02/16/26*)**
- Allow bulk flashcards import/export by collection via JSON **(*completed 02/19/26*)**
- Generate practice quizzes based on collections
- Add collection sharing via link between users (requires more complex permissions)
- Convert login buttons to a single profile button for logging in and out, and showing user info
